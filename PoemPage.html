    <article><h4>We Real Cool by Gwendolyn Brooks</h4>
Eye on the TV
'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavour
It happens to be like;
Killed by the husband
Drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son
She used the poison in his tea
And kissed him goodbye
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies
Don't look at me like
I am a monster
Frown out your one face
But with the other
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV
Stare like a zombie
While the mother
Holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky crying
Why, oh why?
'cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie
Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
Neither the brave nor bold
The writers of stories sold
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same so
Why can't we just admit it?
Blood like rain come down
Drawn on grave and ground
Part vampire
Part warrior
Carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal
Sing to the death rattle

    <div class="adnot">The song confronts the listener with the uncomfortable 
        truth that it’s in their own nature to be gripped watching other people’s
        gedy and suffering, hence the song’s name “vicarious”, which means 
        “experienced as a result of watching [etc.] the activities of other people,
        rather than by doing the activities yourself”, a concept closely related 
        to – and perhaps used as an euphemism for – voyeurism, which is also
        mentioned in the song.

        While seemingly immoral, this shouldn’t be surprising since humans, like
        other animals, have evolved to notice bad things first (e.g. the colour 
        red as the colour of blood), because those who noticed the tasty fruit 
        before the nearby corpse joined the corpse and left no offspring, but 
        those who watched them die from a distance figured out a way to get the 
        fruit safely. This is the ultimate learning from others' mistakes: the 
        fascination that we feel is the nature’s way of holding our attention, 
        while the feeling of safety and satisfaction is our reward.
            
        So don’t hide from yourself behind morality and say it with Keenan: “I 
        need to watch things die”.
