            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
                of the document.
            </p>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a
                markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
                including layout, colors,
                and fonts.
            </p>
            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>
                PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in
                which case PHP generally runs on a web server.
            </p>
            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            <p>
                GitHub offers distributed version control and source code management functionalities with some added
                features.
                It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests,
                task management, and wikis for every project.
            </p>
            <h3>MySQL</h3>
            <p>
                MySQL is an open-source relational database management system used for managing the data that the web
                application requires and uses.
            </p>
            <h3>XAMPP</h3>
            <p>

            <h2>Application architecture</h2>
            <h3>1. Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Our web solution provides a platform for different poems to be translated, commented and annotated. The
                site will provide
                a chart containing information about the activites done by the users. It will also have a feed where
                users and guests can
                see latest and/or most relevant modifications or additions to thesite. The latest translations will be
                avalible via a RSSFeed.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Database</h3>
            <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                <img src="Potter_DB.png" alt="database-pic">
                <figcaption> Database </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The database consists of 7 tables which atomical data.
            </p>
            <h3>3. MVC-pattern</h3>
            <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                <img src="MVC.jpg" alt="mvc">
                <figcaption> MVC </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Our app is based on the MVC-pattern. Each page will contain 3 components:
                <ul>
                    <li>View: used to show the representation of the content to the user.</li>
                    <li>Model: used to constantly make changes between the database and the view.
                        Without the Model, the application would lose the avalibility of the contents from the
                        controller.</li>
                    <li>Controller: The MySQL database that commits all the changes and allows the Model to easily
                        access
                        previously added info and content.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Application Scenarios</h3>
